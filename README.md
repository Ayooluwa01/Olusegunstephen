A passionate and dedicated Software Developer and UI/UX Designer with a strong foundation in mathematics and creative design. With a background in developing both mobile and web applications, I specialize in crafting intuitive, visually appealing, and performance-optimized user interfaces.

My journey as a developer started with a B.Sc. in Mathematics, which gave me a solid understanding of problem-solving, algorithms, and computational logic. This knowledge has been essential in creating scalable and efficient applications. I have a keen eye for design, which allows me to merge functionality with aesthetics, delivering seamless user experiences.

I am always excited to explore new tools and technologies to push the boundaries of what's possible in app development
